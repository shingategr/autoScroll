Load Data on Page Scroll using jQuery Ajax PHP from MySQL Database 


Dozone of page loading when use page loading script or data load using php and jquery,when lots of data can load its required more and more time but you can divided data into segment then page loading speed is fast and faster that why use data loading script required.
An example of infinite scrolling is your Facebook "News Feed" page. You may notice that when you scroll to the bottom of this page, new content will often load automatically, or you will be given a link to "Older Posts" which will load more content when clicked.

Following advantage of load data into segment :
1-data load fast,
2-no required pagination,
3-loader can show,
4-use windows.scroll function,

 which is great but how about loading database records automatically when user scrolls down to the bottom of the page? The technique can be seen in Twitter, Facebook and several other websites.
